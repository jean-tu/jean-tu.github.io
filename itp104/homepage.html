	Completed Assignments:
	<ul>
		<li>My first Web page (This page)</li>
        <li> <a href="JeanTuResume.html" target="-blank"> Jean Tu Resume </a> </li>
        	<p>
        		We were asked to create a webpage that was meant to serve as a resume page. I have listed it is the format of a resume.
        	</p>
        <li> <a href="filmreview.html" target="-blank"> Film Reviews </a> </li>
        	<p>
        		For this assignment we were asked to create a webpage that shows certain details about four or five of the films that we would like to portray on our page. I decided to go with a superhero theme for this assignment, so I choose my favorite superhero films. The paragraph information featured is a review that I pulled off of a website because we were allowed to pull the reviews off of another webpage without having to write our own, so the reviews on the films are not of my own works. There was no plagiarism intended. I enjoyed working on this assignment because it was about something that I enjoy, we were allowed to choose any films that we wanted to build this webpage.
        	</p>
        <li> <a href="calendar.html" target="-blank"> Birthday Calendar </a> </li>
        	<p>
        		The work shown for the calendar is an assignment where we were learning how to integrate text and images. We learned how to overlay text on top of images and create textboxes. So with this knowledge we created our birth month and we were to choose two other events that would be noteworthy enough to be featured on the calendar as well.
        	</p>
        <li> <a href="survey.html" target="-blank"> Survey </a> </li>
        	<p>
        		During this week of class we learned about the different radio buttons, check boxes, text boxes, and the other aspects that one can use for a survey page. We were asked to build a survey page that dealt with a political issue and as a woman I support Hillary Clinton who is running for the 2016 Elections.

                This was just an assignment that we were given where we were supposed to replciate a page that we were given as a homework assignment in preparation for the midterm. The midterm consisted of a written component and a programming component.
