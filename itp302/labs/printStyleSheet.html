    <p>    MacBook computers may be more expensive than regular Windows PCs, but Apple claims it actually saves buyers money in the long-term.</p>

	<p> During its quarterly earnings call on Tuesday, Apple CFO Luca Maestri pointed out that IBM has been saving roughly $270 on each MacBook its employees use instead of a traditional PC, largely due to lower IT support costs and better residual value.</p>

	<p> He also said IBM now has over 30,000 MacBooks deployed within the company, and is adding 1,900 new MacBooks every week. IBM has committed to buy 50,000 MacBooks by the end of this year through its Apple partnership deal struck last year.</p>

	<p> This isn't the first time we've heard Apple and IBM talk about the MacBooks' higher efficiency than the PC. Just a couple of weeks ago, IBM VP Fletcher Previn said at the 2015 JAMF Nation User Conference that just 5% of IBM employees using MacBooks called the IT help desk, versus 40% of PC users. </p>
	
	<p> “Every Mac that we buy is making and saving IBM money,” Previn said.</p>

	<p> That may partly explain why Apple just set a new all-time high record of Mac sales this quarter. In the most recent quarter, Apple sold 5.7 million Macs, up 3% year-over-year, for roughly $6.8 billion in revenue. Mac sales account for the second largest share in Apple's overall revenue, after the iPhones.</p>

	<p> This could also contribute to Apple's penetration in the enterprise market. Apple CEO Tim Cook said the company now generates $25 billion in enterprise sales, up 40% from last year, and called it a "major growth vector" for the future.</p>

	<p> "Enterprise business is not to be underestimated," Cook said. "Everywhere I look, I see significant opportunity."</p>

	<p style="color: red;"> In case you don't know how well Apple is doing, here are some statistics on Apple and a little more back ground information on them: </p> 

	<p> Apple delivered a solid earnings report with just about everything in its right place.</p>

	<p> For the September quarter, it earned $1.96 per share on $51.5 billion in revenue. Its earnings were ahead of expectations, while revenue was roughly in line.</p>

	<p> Apple sold 48.05 million iPhones, which is a 22% jump compared to the previous year, and is about what analysts expected.</p>

	<p> Investors basically yawned at the results, with the stock going nowhere in after-hours trading.</p>

	<p> Apple offered holiday guidance that is a little light of expectations, but is generally fine. If Apple hits the high-end of its guidance, $77.5 billion, it would deliver 4% growth, which is reassuring to investors who were worried Apple's growth would go negative.</p>

	<p> "Our early take is that the guidance seems to imply flattish (74-76 million) iPhones for December," wrote Apple analyst Gene Munster in a note shortly after the numbers were released.</p>

	<p> He added, "This would imply iPhone units down 1% to up 2% year-over-year. We view this as a relief given investors were bracing for the start of the 6S cycle to be down meaningfully (down 5-8% y/y)."</p>

	<p>Here are all the numbers versus expectations:</p>
	<ul> 
    	<li>Revenue: $51.5 billion, up 22% year-over-year (y/y), versus expectations of $51.04 billion.</li>
    	<li>EPS: $1.96, up 38% y/y, versus expectations of $1.88.</li>
    	<li>Net income: $11.1 billion.</li>
    	<li>iPhone units: 48.05 million, up 22% y/y, versus expectations of 48.5 million.</li>
    	<li>iPhone's average selling price: $670.</li>
    	<li>iPad units: 9.88 million, down 20% y/y, versus expectations of 10.2 million.</li>
    	<li>iPad's average selling price: $432.66.</li>
    	<li>Mac units: 5.71 million, up 4% y/y, versus expectations of 5.6 million.</li>
    	<li>Gross margin: 39.9% versus expectations of 39.3%.</li>
    	<li>Cash on hand: $206 billion.</li>
    	<li>December quarter revenue: $75.5-$77.5 versus expectations of $77.13 </li>billion. If Apple hits the top end of its guidance, revenue will be up 4% y/y.</li>
    </ul>

			I use Firefox as my default browser on a Mac, so that is what I have been using to build this news article. I also have Safari and Chrome downloaded on my laptop and when I opened the file on those browsers. A difference that I did notice when I tried it out across my three web browsers is that the transitions for when I hover over an image to shrink the figcaption text was more flowy in Firefox and Chrome, in Safari the word was shrinking in chunks.  
		</p>
		<p> 
			When I tested my created page on a PC, I opened the page on both Firefox and Chrome. In Firefox, when hovering over the image, the text in column 2 glitches for some reason. When hovering over the image in Chrome, it for some reason enlarges the image in a little popupish window, but it still does the minimizing of the text.
