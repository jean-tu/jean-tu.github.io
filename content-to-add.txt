Listed below are just some of the awards that I have recieved!

USC Grace Hopper Scholarship 2016
Selected as one of the female students from the University of Southern California to recieve a full Scholarship to the Grace Hopper Conference 2016 in Houston, Texas.
This was my first confernce and was one of the best experiences I have had!
It was wonderful being able to have the chance to meet so many successful women in computing.
I had written a blog post about my experiences here: Jean's GHC 2016 Experience .
