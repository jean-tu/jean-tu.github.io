                <p>
                  <p>
                    On the 14th of July 2017, there were a group of 6 females that gathered together to help make the world a safer place. At a LinkedIn Office in Sunnyvale.
                    Check out the links below to see what we were working on. We were fortunate to have made it past the preliminary round and make it to the finals; even though we may not have placed in the
                    top 3, it was still a wonderful experience being able to work with these bright young women. Our group was called "The House of Guards" and we did that because it was a play off of the
                    House of Cards and the application that we had built was called GuardHäus.

                <p>I consider this to be one of the projects that I have worked on becuase I had to add my own content to this template to make it my own and show case what I want to be seen.
                    I've changed a couple parts of the layouts and of course the filler text while moving some rows around to be the style that would be suit the information that I would like to get across.

                <h2 class="header-text text-center projects-h2"><a href="https://www.jeanietwo.wordpress.com" target="_blank"> Wordpress</a></h2><br>
                <p>I know it's weird to consider the Wordpress a project, but it's something that I update from time to time when I feel like I have something to say about a subject.
                  I use it as a way to host my blog becuase it's easier to manage my posts through there and I don't have to save them on to my own device, but rather on Wordpress's.

                <p> Those were the ones that are my most current ones and are more so ongoing projects, but I have a couple of projects that I have done
                  for some of the courses that I have taken and they are listed below in the "Other Projects" section </p>
